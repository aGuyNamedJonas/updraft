## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

We build updraft to empower every developer around the world to run their apps on highly scalable cloud-infrastructure with ease.

Updraft is an open module registry for [Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) Modules, offering infrastructure building-blocks that can be easily composed into complex setups.

Services like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and [Netfliy](https://www.netlify.com/) have shown what a superb developer experience for deployments can look like - we strive to enable the same high level of DX for working with generic cloud-infrastructure.
