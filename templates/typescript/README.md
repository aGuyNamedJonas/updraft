# Want to build your own updraft component?
This folder provides the templates that you can access by running `updraft init` or `updraft init @updraft`.  

Get started with building a new updraft component:
- Install the *updraft* cli:  
`npm install --global @updraft/cli`
- Install the *typescript-starter* template:  
`updraft templates @updraft typescript-starter`
- Happy Hacking!

Once you've finished your updraft component, we'd love for you to [submit it as a PR](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Access templates for existing updraft components
If instead, you're looking for quickstart-templates for existing updraft components, run `updraft templates @updraft/<component-name>` e.g. `updraft templates @updraft/aws-static-site`.
