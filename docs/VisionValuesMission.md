> The Vision and Mission described here provide a shared direction for anyone contributing to updraft. The Values described here provide a shared set of guiding principles that help us make decisions about the direction & the focus of this project (and help us give helpful advice in pull requests).

> The values of how we interact with each other in and around this project are described in our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Vision
Empower people to deliver their apps to a global audience

# Mission
Provide building blocks to effortlessly build complex cloud-infrastructure with ease - in the programming language environment developers already know.

# Values
**Simplicity** Simplicity is the high art of making the complex easy. It's a continuous effort, and only when something is easy to understand and easy to use does it start to be *simple*.

**No entry barriers** We strive to make it so easy for people to use, contribute to, and create updraft modules [that a caveman can do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0trj6jCsm6E&list=PL54009BDBDE3A8C8D). We also strive to help make the CDK and updraft modules available for as many programming languages and infrastructure providers as maintainably possible.

**Empowerment** We specifically build updraft to empower people all around the world to bring the positive change to the world that they envision.

# The Stories behind the values
**Simplicity**  
I believe that only simple tools can solve complex problems. My favorite example for this are [binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree): It's simple to explain - you have nodes which represent values, right of that node are all the nodes that have a higher value, left of the node are all the nodes of lower value.

Binary trees are used for finding values in a large number of data-points while only having to check very few nodes to find it. For example: If every person on the planet was sorted in a perfectly balanced binary tree, you would only need 33 layers to organize the world-population of [roughly 8 billion people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population). What that means is that you only have to ask 33 people for their first name and last name to find *anyone* by their name alone.

Again: Ask 33 people to find *anyone* out of 8 billion people, by simply arranging people in a way that anyone before them (sorted alphabetically) is left of them, anyone after them is right of them.  
This blows my mind - and it's such a simple structure that I feel like I could explain this to anyone.

The other reason why simplicity is such an important value to me personally is that it makes me feel good. When something is simple to use and I can easily bring my ideas to life with a tool that I'm using, it makes me feel good because I can bring what's inside my head to the outside world. Simple tools allow me to express my unique ideas for how this world should be different and being able to express those to the world gives me an incredibly deep feeling of self-worth.

The opposite of that is hard to use tools which make me question whether the creative expression I'm trying to use a tool for is even for me. Noticed that? I'm questioning my *creative expression* because a bad tool has made it so hard for me that I wasn't able to get past the learning curve.

Simple tools on the other hand, make a certain kind of creative expression accessible to more people than ever before.

and people who make me feel small by showing me how much better they are than me in using hard to use tools. This has not happened much in the past, but when it has, it was always deeply painful and made me question my abilities as a developer, my choice of profession and quite frankly my own intelligence. Hard to use tools are the perfect breeding ground for people who make other people feel small.

but you know these kind of people: People who for some twisted reason make it their mission to constantly prove you wrong. And their most powerful weapon is to dive into something
