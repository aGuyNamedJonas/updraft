> The Vision and Mission described here provide a shared direction for anyone contributing to updraft. The Values described here provide a shared set of guiding principles that help us make decisions about the direction & the focus of this project (and help us give helpful advice in pull requests).

> The values of how we interact with each other in and around this project are described in our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Vision
Empower people to deliver their apps to a global audience

# Mission
Provide building blocks to effortlessly build complex cloud-infrastructure with ease - in the programming language environment developers already know.

# Values

**Empowerment** We specifically build updraft to empower people all around the world to bring the positive change to the world that they envision.

**Simplicity** Simplicity is the high art of making the complex easy. It's a continuous effort, and only when something is easy to understand and easy to use does it start to be *simple*.

**No entry barriers** We strive to make it so easy for any developer to use modern, scalable cloud-infrastructure [that a caveman can do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0trj6jCsm6E&list=PL54009BDBDE3A8C8D). We also strive to help make CDK and updraft modules available for as many developers, programming languages and infrastructure providers as maintainably possible.

# The Stories behind the values
The following stories are the highly personal reasons why I think the above values and this project itself, is important. The following stories are a very intimate look into what drives me - and it feels pretty risky sharing these. But I hope they help you identify with what updraft is trying to accomplish. If you have any reactions, thoughts, or your own personal story that you would like to respond with, please leave them in the [comment section](https://github.com/aGuyNamedJonas/updraft/issues/52).


**Empowerment**  
I'm sick and tired of the abuse of power that's constantly happening around this world. It makes me feel so helpless watching it play out time and time again because it doesn't feel like I as an individual can do much of anything to *really* keep it from happening again.  

These abuses of power are everywhere. From the abuse of power of the world econonomy in [TODO: Review if this fits! fast fashion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGF3ObOBbac) to the [sexual abuse through individuals](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3MFuxqQwCZSst5Jef9QDbp) and [groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcCj1zNpKoM) to [racially motivated abuse of power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqrhn8khGLM).

The list is endless, because for every individual example that I'm highlighting, I'm committing an injustice against thousands of other horrible examples of disempowerment that might be even more worthy to point people's attention to.

The point of all of this is that *Empowerment* to me seems like one of the few ways of how I personally might ever be able to help balance out the scales of power.  

What's crazy is that I'm writing these lines, fully aware of how much I sound like every tech-startup in silicon valley that's "changing the world" because they managed to make an already luxurious life for people even more luxurious. And yeah I get it - many of these niceties that we have in our lifes today, curteousy of modern tech, actually *did change* what the world looks like. Just not for everyone.

And that's my point: I truly believe that this project can bring access to using *modern cloud infrastructure* to everyone. Everyone around the world.

I definitely hope this project will empower people to change things for the better that were previously unable to do that. Whether that's ever going to happen is anyone's guess - but I think it's worth trying.

**Simplicity**  
I believe that only simple tools can solve complex problems. My favorite example for this are [binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree): It's simple to explain - you have nodes which represent values, right of that node are all the nodes that have a higher value, left of the node are all the nodes of lower value.

Binary trees are used for finding values in a large number of data-points while only having to check very few nodes to find it. For example: If every person on the planet was sorted in a perfectly balanced binary tree, you would only need 33 layers to organize the world-population of [roughly 8 billion people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population). What that means is that you only have to ask 33 people for their first name and last name to find *anyone* by their name alone.

Let me stress this: Ask 33 people to find *anyone* out of 8 billion people, by simply arranging people in a way that anyone before them (sorted alphabetically) is left of them, anyone after them is right of them.  
This blows my mind - and it's such a simple structure that I feel like I could explain this to anyone.

The other reason why simplicity is such an important value to me personally is that it makes me feel good. When something is simple to use and I can easily bring my ideas to life with a tool that I'm using. That makes me feel good because I can bring what's inside my head to the outside world. Simple tools allow me to express my unique ideas for how this world should be different and being able to express those to the world gives me an incredibly deep feeling of self-worth.

The opposite of that is hard to use tools which make me question whether the creative expression I'm trying to use a tool for is even for me. Noticed that? I'm questioning my *creative expression* because a bad tool has made it so hard for me that I wasn't able to get past the learning curve.

Simple tools on the other hand, make a the creative expression they enable accessible to more people than ever before.

**No entry barriers**  
Entry barriers make it hard for people getting in - and often entry barriers can lead to keeping new people (consciously) out.

Entry barriers at its core are often part of what is wrong with this world.  
Entry barriers based on somebody's sex are part of the problem of sexism, entry barriers based on somebody's skin-color is part of the problem of racism, entry barriers based on somebody's geographic location and socio-economic upbringing is part of the problems caused by a global economic inequality.

By drastically reducing the entry barrier to using world-class, modern cloud-infrastructure that largely is free to start out with - and reducing that entry barrier for anyone with an access to Github and the willigness to learn this stuff - we hope to make up for some of the atrocious entry barriers that cause suffering today.

Personally, I hate the feeling of being left out, and of being made to feel like I don't belong. I've had this happen to me so many times in my life, I can't even count it. What really hurt though is when this happened on the job, working as a developer.  We had someone join the team who ended up putting so many entry barriers in my way, I started questioning my own abilities as a developer. Endless pull request reviews, rewriting of my code *for me*, instead of pair-programming *with me*, giving me the feeling of never quite being able to get it right. It got me close to quitting that job (and I had actually hired that person - the irony!).
