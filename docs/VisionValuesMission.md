# Vision
Empower people to deliver their apps to a global audience

# Mission
Provide building blocks to effortlessly build complex cloud-infrastructure with ease - in the programming language environment developers already know.

# Values

**Empowerment** We specifically build updraft to empower people all around the world to bring the positive change to the world that they envision.

**Simplicity** Simplicity is the high art of making the complex easy. It's a continuous effort, and only when something is easy to understand and easy to use does it start to be *simple*.

**No entry barriers** We strive to make it so easy for people to use, contribute to, and create updraft modules [that a caveman can do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0trj6jCsm6E&list=PL54009BDBDE3A8C8D). We also strive to help make the CDK and updraft modules available for as many programming languages and infrastructure providers as maintainably possible.

# The Stories behind the values
**Empowerment**  
I'm sick and tired of the abuse of power that's constantly happening around this world. It makes me feel so helpless watching it play out time and time again because it doesn't feel like I as an individual can do much of anything to *really* keep it from happening again.  

And these abuses of power are everywhere. From the abuse of power of the world ecnonomy in [TODO: Review if this fits! fast fashion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGF3ObOBbac) to the sexual abuse through [individuals](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3MFuxqQwCZSst5Jef9QDbp) and [groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcCj1zNpKoM) to the systematic abuse of power [TODO: Review if this fits! over minorities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqrhn8khGLM).

The list is endless, because for every individual example that I'm highlighting, I'm committing an injustice against thousands of other horrible examples of disempowerment that might be even more worthy to point people's attention to.

The point of all of this is that **Empowerment** to me seems like one of the few ways of how I personally might ever be able to help balance out the scales of power.  
Tech is the future of a lot of things - making it accessible to more people than before, by empowering them to run their own cloud infrastructure is the kind of *empowerement* that I can help achieve with the skillset that I have.  

To tell you the truth, I don't know if this will ever empower anyone who wasn't empowered before. So I don't know if we'll ever meet this goal. But I think it's worth a shot. So I really hope you're onboard for that.

**Simplicity**  
I believe that only simple tools can solve complex problems. My favorite example for this are [binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree): It's simple to explain - you have nodes which represent values, right of that node are all the nodes that have a higher value, left of the node are all the nodes of lower value.

Binary trees are used for finding values in a large number of data-points while only having to check very few nodes to find it. For example: If every person on the planet was sorted in a perfectly balanced binary tree, you would only need 33 layers to organize the world-population of [roughly 8 billion people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population). What that means is that you only have to ask 33 people for their first name and last name to find *anyone* by their name alone.

Let me stress this: Ask 33 people to find *anyone* out of 8 billion people, by simply arranging people in a way that anyone before them (sorted alphabetically) is left of them, anyone after them is right of them.  
This blows my mind - and it's such a simple structure that I feel like I could explain this to anyone.

The other reason why simplicity is such an important value to me personally is that it makes me feel good. When something is simple to use and I can easily bring my ideas to life with a tool that I'm using. That makes me feel good because I can bring what's inside my head to the outside world. Simple tools allow me to express my unique ideas for how this world should be different and being able to express those to the world gives me an incredibly deep feeling of self-worth.

The opposite of that is hard to use tools which make me question whether the creative expression I'm trying to use a tool for is even for me. Noticed that? I'm questioning my *creative expression* because a bad tool has made it so hard for me that I wasn't able to get past the learning curve.

Simple tools on the other hand, make a the creative expression they enable accessible to more people than ever before.

**No entry barriers**  
Entry barriers make it hard for people getting in - and often entry barriers can lead to keeping new people (consciously) out.

Entry barriers at its core are often part of what is wrong with this world.  
Entry barriers based on somebody's sex are part of the problem of sexism, entry barriers based on somebody's skin-color is part of the problem of racism, entry barriers based on somebody's geographic location and socio-economic upbringing is part of a global economic inequality.

By drastically reducing the entry barrier to using world-class, modern cloud-infrastructure that largely is free to start out with - and reducing that entry barrier for anyone with an access to Github and the willigness to learn this stuff - we hope to make up for some of the atrocious entry barriers that cause suffering today.

On a personal note: I hate feeling left-out - not being able to understand something. I never considered myself the best logical-thinker (and I have met many people who are far better at this than I am). And yet I love the feeling of being able to perform the complete package - have the skills to build frontends, backend, and even run this stuff in the cloud. It's an incredibly feeling to get to work with systems that have no problem at all bringing your app - your own creative work - to millions of users everyday.

That's some powerful stuff we get to work with here - let's bring that same power to many more people, by removing the entry barriers for them.

Sharing the personal stories that inform values is inspired by the amazing book [Tribal Leadership](https://www.triballeadership.net/).



Entry barriers never served the people trying to get in, they only ever served to keep people out.





and people who make me feel small by showing me how much better they are than me in using hard to use tools. This has not happened much in the past, but when it has, it was always deeply painful and made me question my abilities as a developer, my choice of profession and quite frankly my own intelligence. Hard to use tools are the perfect breeding ground for people who make other people feel small.

but you know these kind of people: People who for some twisted reason make it their mission to constantly prove you wrong. And their most powerful weapon is to dive into something
