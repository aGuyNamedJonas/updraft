# Vision
Empower people to deliver their apps to a global audience

# Mission
Provide building blocks to effortlessly build complex cloud-infrastructure with ease - in the programming language environment developers already know.

# Values
**Simplicity** Simplicity is the high art of making the complex easy. It's a continuous effort, and only when something is easy to understand and easy to use does it start to be *simple*.

**No entry barriers** We strive to make it so easy for people to use, contribute to, and create updraft modules that a caveman can do it. We also strive to help make the CDK and updraft modules available for as many programming languages and infrastructure providers as maintainably possible.

**Empowerment** We specifically build updraft to empower people all around the world to bring the positive change to the world that they envision.
